They have intentionally broken the legacy app. I have never seen a developer take away something  tools one already had in a previous version. This is a new low in the pursuit of revenue. I would urge you to not use Enlight as it would encourage this kind of behavior in other developers. Just delete Enlight and move on. Quality photo editing apps are a dime a dozen and for a monthly subscription there certainly are much higher quality editors out there than Enlight. In any case you decide.

I appreciate the effort that has gone into this game but at the same time it still needs to be better. the game has decent stability over all but i still find my device crashing often. the pokestop speed lock is absolutely rediculous. riding a bicycle in a pokemon game was half the game and your speed lock is so low it effects my bike. fix that. There probably should also be a daily rewards page not some dumb temporary pop up. last but not least after the pokemon fest failure i would think the devs are gonna actually take the time to figure out if the game is even gonna work instead of focusing on a quick buck i swear the only link that works perfect is the poke coin special boxes lol. pvp and trading needs to be added to this game immediately or your gonna lose a huge player base. trust me i know. your legendary raids have been a headache and people want something that will be an enjoyment. player vs player battles. please stop putting this off and ill give better review.,0,1,0,1,0

I enjoy catching the Pokmon with my Hubby and kids. I'm not big on the battles and fights I like collecting the Pokmon.

I want to try and catch them all and if we could trade Pokmon I would have a higher chance. Also you can make it possible to do personal raids where you can either trade or fight the person you run into. Just like the show where Ash meets new friends andor enemies. Makes the game seem more...real to see nearby Pokmon goers through the app to friend or fight. Also I live in the middle of the woods and I can walk all day in my neighborhood but we have no Pokmon in our area... we have to drive to town to catch them  so please try and expand your Pokmon areas to even places like the middle of the back woods of Alabama  Other than that I enjoy the game very much,0,1,0,0,0

The workout itself is amazing because I can keep my device turned off and the workout will still continue. The addons in this app are also great, but I feel like the initial workout is enough. The reasons why I gave this a 45 instead of a 55 is because of the lack of updates and the improvements there could be on the app to accommodate more recent devices, like the iPhone 6 or 7. Since it is out of date, the app drains a bit more battery on newer devices than it does on older ones your device will send you a notification of this issue when using the app as a reminder.
